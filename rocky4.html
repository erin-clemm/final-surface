    <h2>Movie Summary</h2>
    <h6>Now that Rocky and Apollo have become good friends, Apollo expresses his want to return to the ring. Rocky tells him that he should be cautious, but he wants to support his friend. The two hear about a new Russian boxer named Drago, who is trained using new age technology. Drago’s manager tells the media that they want him to fight an American champion, to prove that their ways of training are better than the United States’. Apollo is eager to take the fight, but Rocky is not so sure. Apollo pushes on, and fights Drago. The fight ends with Apollo laying dead in the ring, after refusing to let Rocky throw in the towel for him. Rocky then begins training to fight Drago, despite recently announcing that he would soon be retiring. Rocky trains in the Russian countryside with no technology to prepare for the fight. Rocky defeats the hulking Russian, avenging his friend, and brings pride to his country.</h6>
