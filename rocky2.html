    <h2>Movie Summary</h2>
    <h6> After Rocky just barely lost the championship bout to Apollo, he uses his pay from the fight to settle down and start a family with Adrian. Apollo continues to beg Rocky for a rematch to their Championship fight, so that he can heal his pride. Rocky tries to adapt to becoming a blue collar worker, since he is no longer receiving money as he quit fighting, but he struggles to find a good fit. When Adrian goes into a coma due to birth complications with their son, Rocky spends every moment by her bedside. When she wakes, she tells him to take the fight and win for her. Rocky goes on to win the rematch, and become the heavyweight champion.
