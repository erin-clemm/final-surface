    <h2>Movie Summary</h2>
    <h6> Rocky, a small-time boxer from Philadelphia, gets the opportunity of a lifetime when he is given the chance to fight against the heavyweight world champion, Apollo Creed. Rocky meets a girl named Adrian, who he likes a lot, and they start a relationship. Rocky loses the fight by a hair, which doesnâ€™t sit right with Apollo, who feels that he did not truly win.
